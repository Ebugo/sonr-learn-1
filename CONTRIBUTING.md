Welcome to the `Sonr Learn` project!

This is an open-source learning platform created by the Sonr Developer Community and as such, we require contributors to be members of the Sonr Developer Community. We use planning and communication tools, such as Discord.

To join the Developer Community, I'd recommend reading our [What is Sonr](https://www.onsonr.com/about) post.

Once you're a member, to contribute code or content:

- please join us in the Developer Community Discord
- setup the project by visiting our [README.md](./README.md)
- add code or content by forking this repo. You can then submit PRs for review.

_NB: You do not need to be added to the Sonr GitHub organization to
submit PRs._
